@"The further my war dragged on, the further I sank into negligence. This specter is the crux of my failure.
I hid behind my excuses, calling them duties. Fighting the gods. Training. Ruling.
I had the time and resources to devote. I was simply paralyzed by apathy.
The scores of prisoners I kept in the dungeon I claimed perished alongside their jailors.
Within those hexed walls, none may know rest, and their souls coalesced into a formless monster.
Boiling with rage, wallowing in sorrow, screaming in madness. The amalgamation was uncontrollable.
The dragon cult was furious, their leader demanding I put the haunt down myself.
I did not answer. I had long since become deaf to the world outside my crusade. Do not fall as I have.";
