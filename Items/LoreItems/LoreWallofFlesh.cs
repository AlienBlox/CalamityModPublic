@"To contain the essence of a slain God is no small thing. It is rather a towering, ghastly construct.
The Wall was lashed together with foul sinew and fouler magics, forming a rudimentary prison of flesh.
It served its purpose: halting the diffusion of undue divine influence.
Were it not for this alchemical breakthrough, the very world I fought for may have been lost in the carnage I wrought.
My methods have since evolved. I need not contain such essences, when they can be devoured.
May you channel my valor in combating the resulting outpour of energies.";
