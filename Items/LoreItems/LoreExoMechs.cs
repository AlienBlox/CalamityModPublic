@"What a terrifying marvel of engineering. Draedon's specialty always lay in the machines of war, but these are immaculate.
His bold claim that no God can match his work is, however, incorrect. He is not privy to the Traitor almighty.

Draedon is an amoral monster beyond compare. He is entirely devoid of humanity and compassion.
With technology this incomprehensibly advanced, he stands at the precipice of apotheosis.
He can fabricate such dreadful, synthetic nightmares at will. His resources must be nigh unlimited.
Were he to lose his temper, if he even has one, all of life's hopes would be smothered in an instant, silenced by a torrent of silicon.
Though, perhaps you may leverage his unimaginable craft to your advantage, and seek insight from him.";
